The project is a flying wing. Developed circuits and firmware for the control panel and receiver. In as a brains is used bluepill STM32F103C8T6 stitched under Arduino. As a module of the radio channel used by the NRF24L01+ c PA and LNA. SG90 compatible servos are suitable for elevons. ESC can be anything. Three control modes are implemented: manual, semi-automatic and automatic. In manual mode, the pilot directly controls the position of the ailerons. In semi-automatic mode, the angular roll and pitch speeds are set. And in automatic mode, the roll and pitch angles are set. The semi-automatic and automatic modes use the MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope for alignment.
